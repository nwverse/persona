/**
 * The versioned boundary between the hub-hosted web renderer and its optional Electron shell.
 *
 * This file is types only. Both sides import it with `import type`; it emits no runtime module and owns no IPC.
 * The desktop may be older than the web it loads: version 1 is additive only. The web must feature-detect a method
 * added after an older shell before calling it. An incompatible change increments `version` and needs a migration path.
