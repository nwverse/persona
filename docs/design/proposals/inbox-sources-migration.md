# Proposal: built-in Inbox sources become an extension's read tools plus a default subscription

Status: approved by the owner on 2026-11-13 (#6150), with the decisions in section 5. Step C of the Inbox Sources work,
after #5278 and #5741. It is built one step at a time (section 4), each its own issue and PR; nothing is built yet. Covers the extension manager (`server/internal/extmgr`,
`server/internal/subscriptions`), the assistant's Inbox (`server/internal/assistant`) and the Inbox Sources pages; the
clients change only where a step says so.

## 1. Goal

**One sentence**: every Inbox source works one way, a read tool and a subscription that says what to pull and where it
goes, and moving a built-in source to that way loses nothing the owner uses today.

**Reached when**, for each migrated source:

| # | The owner sees | Checked by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | The same items as before, with nothing missed or doubled at the switch | A replay test: one day of the source's fixtures through the built-in and through the subscription gives the same item ids, titles, senders and tiers |
| G2 | Reply, Draft and the AI twin work as before | The source's reply and twin tests pass against the subscription item |
| G3 | Mutes, policies and items already done still apply | Existing mutes and done threads match the migrated items (test on a copied state) |
| G4 | It can be switched back | Turning the migration off restores the built-in with no re-delivered or lost items (test) |
| G5 | One list, one set of controls | Inbox Sources shows the source as a subscription; the built-in row is gone |

## 2. What happens today

Read from the code on 2026-11-13. Functions are in `server/internal/` unless the path says otherwise.

### 2a. Two pipelines

| Fact | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Built-in sources (mail, GitHub, iMessage, Lark through `larkcli`) are connectors the manager reads itself: a poll every 2 minutes, mail every 3, a kick debounced 3 s | `inboxPoll`, `inboxMailPoll`, `inboxDebounce`, `collectInbox` in `extmgr/inbox.go`; `readMail`, `readConnectors` in `extmgr/inbox_read.go` |
| Subscriptions call an extension's or connector's read tool on their own schedule: checked every 30 s, at least 5 minutes between pulls, 20 s between calls and 120 calls an hour per connector | `tickEvery`, `callGap`, `defaultPerHour` in `subscriptions/runner.go`; `minInterval` in `subscriptions/service.go` |
| A subscription hands the Inbox its items on poll and full rounds as a source with an id, a name, `Extension: true`, kinds and counts, never `Group`, `Meta`, `Settles` or `Migrated` | `readSubscriptions` in `extmgr/subscriptions.go` |
| The built-ins already have read tools a subscription can call: mail's derived catalog (`search` by account, mailbox, query), GitHub's `search`/`read`/`diff`/`checks`, iMessage's JSON reads. `larkcli` has text tools only, which a recipe can use only as snapshots | `ReadCatalog` in `connector/catalog.go`; `readTools` in `connector/github/tools.go`; `CallJSON` in `connector/imessage/persona.go`, `extmgr/mail_connector.go`; `docs/extensions/subscriptions.md` "Recipe format" |

### 2b. What a subscription item lacks

| Ability | Built-in today | Subscription item today | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reply | GitHub comments unless locked; Lark when the latest message has an id; mail from the receiving account with threading headers; iMessage none (`sms:` link). Sent once per `send_id` | `can_reply` false. Even if set, `connectorOf(<subscription id>)` finds no connector: subscription ids (`sub_<hex>`) can never be connector ids | `replyInboxDo` in `assistant/inbox_triage.go`; `replyConnectorItem` in `assistant/inbox_connectors.go`; `inboxAppCall`, `sendInboxOnce` in `extmgr/inbox_calls.go`, `extmgr/inbox_reply.go`; `newID` in `subscriptions/service.go` |
| AI twin | Its prompt names the Lark feed and account, the mail account, mailbox and UID, the doc or moment, GitHub's URL and read tools; Lark and mail chats bring knowledge-base context | Only the subscription id: the prompt's line on where a reply goes ends empty, no URL (printed for GitHub only), no connector or tool to read with, no KB chat | `escalate` in `assistant/inbox_handle.go`; `inboxAgentFor`, `kbChatOf` in `assistant/inbox_agent.go`; `prompts/inbox/agent_ref.md` |
| Read state | Inbound only: mail's seen flags (also for items that fell off the page, `settleMailOffPage` + `inbox.mail_flags`), connectors' `Read`, GitHub's inferred read, settling. Nothing writes read or done back to any source | No `Read`, no `Settles`; `Done` only on the failing notice. A recipe has no `seen` field | `applyMail`, `mailReadElsewhere`, `settleMailOffPage` in `assistant/`; `InboxSettler` in `connector/inbox.go`; `ConnectorSubscriptionFields` in `sdk/go/wire/wire_gen.go`; `docs/assistant/inbox.md` "Connector: GitHub (2026-11-02)" |
| Real time | All polled (no IMAP IDLE, no GitHub webhooks). An extension program's `changed` event kicks the Inbox at once | `changed` never starts a run; at best the next check, 5 minutes apart. Push sources exist only for a full-access paired device over HTTP: 20 items a push, 300 an hour, items carry key, title, body, app, link, time | `connectorChanged`, `kickInbox` in `extmgr/connectors.go`; `Push`, `pushItemsMost`, `pushPerHourMost` in `subscriptions/push.go`; `subscriptionRoutes` in `extmgr/subscriptions.go` |
| Identity for mutes and policies | Mutes and policies key on source + tag + value: mail by address, GitHub by repo, Lark by chat | Tags are `source` and `sender` = the lowercased display name. Digest, snapshot and failing rows have no sender, so no mute or policy option at all | `mutesOf`, `mutedBy`, `mutableTags` in `assistant/inbox_mutes.go`; `deliverer.tags` in `subscriptions/deliver.go`; `docs/assistant/inbox.md` "Policies (2026-11-06, #5747)" |
| Item ids and done threads | `<source>:sha1(thread, last)`; "already handled" per source + thread | `<sub>:sha1(...)`: a different source, so none of a built-in's done threads match | `applyConnector` in `assistant/inbox_connectors.go`; `threadThing` in `subscriptions/deliver.go` |
| Read errors | `mail:<account>` and connector read errors show in the Inbox at once | A failing pull shows only as the failing notice after 24 hours | `readMail` in `extmgr/inbox_read.go`; `failing` in `subscriptions/deliver.go` |
| Knowledge base | Media, history import, poll interval, iMessage's fence; mail per account with UIDVALIDITY cursors and one chat per correspondent | `ArchiveSource{ID}` only: changes 100 a page from a seq cursor, chats by thread hash, the sender's name only, kept 30 days, no history import | `kbArchives` in `extmgr/kb_sources.go`; `mailConnector.Changes` in `extmgr/mail_connector.go`; `Service.Changes`, `chatOf` in `subscriptions/deliver.go` |
| Triage | Admitted at once, tiers from the connector, rules from `larkcli` options or the extension | Triaged before admission; tiers from the recipe's rule fallback; rules the subscription's own or the global ones | `docs/assistant/inbox.md` "AI triage"; `fallback` in `subscriptions/deliver.go`; `builtinSources.rules` in `extmgr/inbox_sources.go` |
| Turning on | On unless switched off; settings in `manager.json` (`github.inbox`, `ignore_branches`, `lark.cli.profile`) | Created with both destinations off; turning on needs a full-access device and a confirmation; the assistant's saves need the phone's approval | `Service.Create`; `docs/extensions/subscriptions.md` "Pages", "Assistant tools"; `docs/operations/config.md` "manager.json" |

A precedent exists for moving a source while keeping its ids: `MigratableConnectors` (lark, github) lets a same-id
extension take over a built-in connector with its item ids, mutes and knowledge base (`connectorwire/inbox.go`;
`docs/extensions/extensions.md` "GitHub: from hub to extension (#2830)").

## 3. Design

Subscriptions stay read-only: a recipe never calls a write tool (`docs/extensions/subscriptions.md` "Read-only tools").
Replying, the twin and read state go through the connector that the subscription reads, as they do for a built-in today.

### 3a. A migrated subscription keeps the built-in's identity

A built-in's default subscription has a fixed id, `sub_m_<connector id>` (one per connector, one per mail account; P5a,
#6265). Its Inbox items use the built-in's source id and item ids, not `sub_<hex>`. Existing mutes, policies, done threads,
`read_error` keys and knowledge-base chats then match without rewriting state, as `MigratableConnectors` does. Only the
manager can create such a subscription. It can't be duplicated, and deleting it means switching the migration back (3g).

### 3b. Recipe fields for identity, reply and read state

`ConnectorSubscriptionFields` gains optional `sender_id`, `chat`, `chat_name`, `reply_to` and `seen`, each mapped from
the read tool's JSON like the existing fields:

- `sender_id` and `chat` become tags (`sender` by id, `chat` named by `chat_name`), so mutes and policies can name them.
  The display name stays the label. Done in P1a (#6165).
- `seen` becomes the item's `Read`. An item missing from a full page settles as the built-ins' `Settles` does, so read
  elsewhere means read here (inbound only, as today).
- `reply_to` is the line saying where a reply goes and who sees it, as a built-in item's `ReplyTo` ("Comment on
  example-org/example-repo#12 (anyone who can see the repo)"). With it set and the connector able to reply, the item gets
  `CanReply`. The reply itself addresses the connector's own thread (the recipe's existing `thread`) and the newest
  item's `id` as `Last`, which a subscription item already holds.

Recipes without the new fields behave as today. The SDK's wire types and `schema/` change with them.

### 3c. Reply goes to the subscription's connector

For an item from a subscription with `reply_to`, the assistant sends `inbox.reply {source, reply, send_id}` as today.
The manager resolves the source to the subscription's connector, not to a connector with that id, and calls its
`Inbox.Reply` with the connector's thread and `Last` (`InboxReply` in `connectorwire/inbox.go`). Send-once
(`sendInboxOnce`), mail's receiving account and threading headers are unchanged. A connector with no reply (iMessage) keeps `CanReply` false. Draft and the twin's reply suggestion then check
`CanReply` before offering (today `suggestIn.check` doesn't).

### 3d. The twin gets what it needs to read

`agent_ref.md` prints, for any connector item, the link, the connector and source the subscription reads, the read
tool it may call and its `reply_to`, instead of only GitHub's. `kbChatOf` uses the subscription's
knowledge-base chat (`chatOf`). The twin's escalation rules don't change.

### 3e. Real time

- A connector's `changed` event also starts a run of that connector's subscriptions, within `callGap` and the hourly
  cap, so a migrated source is as fast as its built-in (at most a few seconds behind a kick instead of 5 minutes).
- Sources that push rather than poll (Lark's events) use a push source owned by an extension. The extension's program
  sends items with the push source's fields plus the new identity and reply fields, under the same 20-a-push and
  300-an-hour limits. Only the extension that owns a push source may push to it. That replaces "only a paired device
  over HTTP" for this case, and the device path stays as it is.

### 3f. The knowledge base stays on the built-in path at first

The subscription knowledge-base path lacks media, history import and mail's per-account cursors. A migrated source
therefore moves its **Inbox** feed first. Its archive stays with `kbArchives` until the subscription path has what the
source uses, which is its own later step per source. Inbox Sources shows both switches on the one subscription row
either way.

### 3g. Switching, compatibility and rollback

- **Per source**, the default subscription's `migrated` mark (P5a, #6265; it takes the place of a separate
  `inbox.migrated` setting), changed from Inbox Sources with one confirmation:
  - **On**: the built-in's Inbox feed goes off and its default subscription on, in one step. The subscription's
    catch-up reaches `catchupBack`'s day before and comes as rows, never a digest: the rows the built-in already
    brought are known by their item ids (3a), so nothing is missed and nothing comes in twice (as built in P5a).
  - **Off**: the reverse. The subscription stays, off, with its seen keys, so switching on again re-delivers nothing.
- **Defaults**: an existing install keeps the built-in until the owner switches it. A new install gets a source's
  default subscription instead of its built-in once that source has run switched on, on the owner's hub, for a week
  without a difference (decision 6).
- **Mixed versions** (as built in P5a: `docs/extensions/subscriptions.md` "Built-in sources switched to their default
  subscription"):
  - The default subscription's own destination switches stay off in storage, so a manager that does not know the mark
    never pulls it, and the built-in's feed, never switched off, comes back on a rollback. The switch is on the
    manager-drawn pages, so no client feature flag is needed.
  - An assistant without the new reply routing must not get `CanReply` for those items. The assistant reports that it
    routes them (part of P2), and the manager sets `CanReply` only then, so nothing offers a reply that fails.
  - An older manager ignores `migrates` and the new recipe fields. Without the setting it never switches, so rolling
    back the hub restores the built-ins.
- **Docs**: `docs/extensions/subscriptions.md` "Built-in sources switched to their default subscription" holds the
  mixed-version behavior (`docs/protocol/rolling-upgrade-compatibility.md` stays the rename's checklist).

## 4. Order

Smallest gap first, so each step proves part of the design before the harder sources:

| Step | What | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Recipe fields: P1a `sender_id`, `chat`, `chat_name` (#6165); P1b `seen` (#6176); P1c a failing pull shows as the source's read error at once (#6189) | 3b |
| P2 | The `reply_to` field; reply through the subscription's connector (#6198). The apps already offer Draft only with `CanReply` | 3b, 3c |
| P3 | The twin's source info and knowledge-base chat for subscription items (#6222) | 3d |
| P4 | P4a `changed` starts runs (#6247); P4b extension-owned push sources | 3e |
| P5 | P5a the default subscription's fixed id and `migrated` mark, delivery under the built-in's id, catch-up as rows, rollback (#6265); P5b the switch on the Inbox Sources pages, with M1 | 3a, 3g |
| M1 | **iMessage**: no reply to carry over; needs `seen`, `sender_id`, `chat` and the `changed` kick | P1, P4, P5 |
| M2 | **GitHub**: comments as replies, inferred read, repo mutes. Its read tools first need a notifications tool | P1–P5 |
| M3 | **Lark**: JSON read tools for `larkcli` first, then its events through a push source, replies | P1–P5 |
| M4 | **Mail**, one subscription per account: replies with threading, seen flags and off-page settling, read errors per account, translations | P1–P5 |
| K1… | Each source's knowledge-base feed, once the subscription path has what it uses (3f) | per source |

Each M step ships behind the switch and lands with the G1–G4 tests for that source. A source moves on new installs
only after it has run switched on, on the owner's hub, for a week without a difference.

## 5. Decisions (owner, 2026-11-13)

1. **Identity (3a)**: a migrated subscription keeps the built-in's source and item ids. Mutes, policies, done threads
   and read errors then match without rewriting state, as with `MigratableConnectors`.
2. **Consent at the switch (3g)**: the built-in was already on, so switching keeps the source on, with one confirmation
   for the source. Its default subscription doesn't ask again as a new subscription would.
3. **Knowledge base (3f)**: the Inbox feed moves first. Each source's archive is a later step, once the subscription
   path has what the source uses.
4. **Real time (3e)**: Lark's events come through a push source owned by an extension. Lark keeps no built-in event
   path.
5. **Order (4)**: iMessage, GitHub, Lark, mail.
6. **New installs (3g)**: a source switches on new installs only after it has run switched on, on the owner's hub, for
   a week without a difference. It doesn't wait for the other sources.

## 6. Principles self-check (`docs/design/PRINCIPLES.md`)

- **1 Defaults first**: existing installs change nothing until a source is switched; new installs get the same sources,
  on, as today.
- **2 Progressive disclosure**: one switch per source in Inbox Sources; recipes stay hidden behind the subscription's
  page.
- **3 User control**: every switch is visible, takes one confirmation and can be switched back (3g, G4).
- **4 Consistency first**: one pipeline and one row type for every source; mutes, policies and replies behave the same
  on both sides of the switch.
- **5 Model and product separate**: no model change; the twin only gets source facts it lacked.
- **6 Checkable**: G1–G5, each a test or a screenshot.
- **7 Fast, local-first and stateful**: the `changed` kick keeps a migrated source as fast as its built-in. Failures keep
  showing as read errors, which needs P1 to report a failing pull at once rather than after 24 hours.
