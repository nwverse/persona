# Agent sandbox

On macOS, the agents Persona starts can run under `sandbox-exec` with everything allowed except the data directory's
secrets. It is off until you turn it on, and Linux is not supported yet (#5357).

An agent in the sandbox keeps the network, the home directory, git, ssh, compilers and the Keychain. It cannot open
`secret.key`, `hub.json` or the other credential files in the data directory (`~/.persona` or where
`PERSONA_HOME` points), by any name and from any child process.

## It closes the data directory's secrets to the agents Persona starts

Every row below fails inside the sandbox and works outside it (`TestDarwinAgentSandboxForReal` checks each one).

| An agent tries to | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Read or copy `secret.key`, `handles.key`, any other `*.key` at the top, `hub.json`, `link.json`, a TLS key | Refused, also through `~/.persona`, a symlink elsewhere, or a child process such as Python or `cp` |
| Read a backup or a copy being written (`secret.key.bak`, `hub.json.bak`, the `.hub.json.*` file a rewrite renames into place) | Refused |
| Read the Cloudflare tunnel token (`relay-tunnel.token`), the Postgres password (`docker/db-password`), or any other `*.token` / `*.secret` / `*.password` at the top of the data directory | Refused |
| Read a manager's folder (`managers/`) or an extension's sign-in data (`extensions/data/`) | Refused |
| Read another launcher's merged settings in `launcher-settings/` | Refused; the files this start passes to its own agent stay readable |
| Connect to an extension's proxy socket or the hub's edge socket (`extensions/run/`, `run/`) | Refused |
| Rename the data directory, a folder above it, or `extensions/` (which holds `extensions/data/` and `extensions/run/`), or replace the `~/.persona` link | Refused, so the secrets cannot be moved out from under the rules (#6117) |
| Remove the switch file `agent-sandbox.on` | Refused |
| Read `launch.key`, which `personad launch` needs before the node hands out a managed launcher's settings (`launcher.env` on `node.sock`, #5588) | Refused, so the node refuses an agent any launcher's settings |

A listing such as `ls -l ~/.persona` still shows the secret files' names, sizes and times; only their contents are
closed. Persona's own files stay usable: `node.sock` (hooks and MCP), `mcp.json`, `claude-settings.json`, `bin/`, the
assistant's directories, the knowledge base in `data/`, and `personad` itself.

## Some ways to the secrets stay open

The sandbox covers only the processes Persona starts in it. These reach the secrets anyway:

- **Docker.** An agent that can run `docker` can mount the data directory into a container and read it there.
  `personad hub setup` runs Postgres in Docker, so Docker is there on most hub machines. Closing the Docker socket
  would take Docker away from every agent, so the sandbox leaves it open.
- **Terminals and scripts you start yourself**, and agents Persona does not start: Paseo, DSH and other runtimes,
  daemons, botmux, sessions Herdr App or Orca open themselves, the Codex desktop app.
- **Starts this version does not wrap**: an agent started in herdr or Orca, or resumed after herdr restarts, by a
  launcher other than `personad launch` (plain `claude`, a `~/.zshrc` alias or function); Codex conversations on the
  assistant; a plain `codex` (see "A start is wrapped only when the agent's own sandbox is surely off"). While the
  switch is on, the node records each such herdr or Orca start as `skipped` under `pane`, so the doctor warns; a later
  start there through a managed launcher clears it.
- **Code that runs later outside the sandbox**: files an agent writes for another program to run (shell startup
  files, LaunchAgents, git hooks), and programs outside the sandbox it can drive (`open`, `osascript`, `launchctl`,
  herdr's or tmux's sockets, `ssh localhost`).
- **The hub's API** with a token an agent already has, and **`~/.ssh`** keys.

## Four starts are wrapped

`sandbox.WrapAgent` puts `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -p <profile>` in front of the command and `PERSONA_AGENT_SANDBOXED=1`
in its environment. The process keeps its pid, so the node still recognizes the agent by it.

| Start | Started by | Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The assistant's Claude on the CLI with plain `claude` or a `~/.zshrc` launcher, guests included | the node | `assistantCLICommand`, `server/internal/node/assistant_start.go` |
| The assistant's Claude on the Agent SDK: the bridge and the claude it starts | the node | `sdkCommand`, `server/internal/node/assistant_sdk.go` |
| A managed launcher, `personad launch <name>`: in herdr, for the assistant, and when the node checks a launcher | a pane's shell, or the node | `launchExec`, `server/internal/node/managed.go` |
| A Codex started from the phone, `personad codex-start` | the pane's shell | `codexStartExec`, `server/internal/node/codex_start.go` |

`personad launch` itself stays outside the sandbox: it reads `launch.key` and fetches the launcher's settings from the
node first, then wraps only the agent it execs. So for a managed launcher the assistant does not wrap its shell, and
`personad launch` wraps the claude it starts. A start inside the sandbox (`PERSONA_AGENT_SANDBOXED=1` in its
environment) runs as it is: the sandbox is inherited, and a second `sandbox-exec` inside it would fail.

## A start is wrapped only when the agent's own sandbox is surely off

`sandbox-exec` cannot apply a profile inside another one that denies anything: the inner one exits 71 with
`sandbox_apply: Operation not permitted`. Claude Code's own sandbox and Codex's `read-only` and `workspace-write` modes
use it, so wrapping them would break every command they run. When Persona cannot tell, it does not wrap, and the doctor
says why.

  A[Agent start] --> B{Switch on?}
  B -- no --> R[Run as before]
  B -- yes --> C{macOS with sandbox-exec?}
  C -- no --> R
  C -- yes --> D{Agent's own sandbox surely off?}
  D -- "no or cannot tell" --> R
  D -- yes --> E{Data directory below home and not holding the working directory?}
  E -- no --> R
  E -- yes --> F{sandbox-exec takes the rules?}
  F -- no --> R
  F -- yes --> W[Run under sandbox-exec]
```

Every "Run as before" except the first records why (`skipped`, `unsupported` or `unavailable`) for the doctor.

- **Claude** is wrapped when nothing sets `sandbox.enabled` to `true`: `settings.json` in `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or
  `~/.claude` (on the node, in every Claude config directory it knows), `.claude/settings.json` and
  `.claude/settings.local.json` in the working directory and each folder above it,
  `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` and `managed-settings.d/`, and `--settings`. A file
  that is there but cannot be read counts as on.
- **Codex** is wrapped when it runs `danger-full-access` in its own process. A plain `codex` 0.163 runs its tools in the
  shared app-server daemon, which wrapping the terminal UI does not reach, so the launcher needs one of the flags that
  keep it in its own process (`-c`, `-p` and the rest of `codexConfigFlags`). The mode is read in Codex's order:
  `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, `-s` or `--full-auto`, the profile's `sandbox_mode`, `-c sandbox_mode`,
  then `config.toml` in `CODEX_HOME`. A project's `.codex/config.toml`, `/etc/codex/managed_config.toml` or
  `requirements.toml`, a profile written as a dotted key, and `--remote` all count as cannot tell.
- **Other agents** (`agy` and the rest) are not wrapped until their own sandboxes have been checked.

The data directory check exists because the rules match names in it: with `PERSONA_HOME=~` they would reach every
`hub.json` or `*.pem` in the home's top level. Persona's own working directories inside it (`assistant/`, `health/`,
`guest/`) are fine.

## The rules close names at the top of the data directory and a few folders whole

The profile starts from `(allow default)` and adds denials, all on real paths (`/tmp` is `/private/tmp`); each name the
data directory goes by is resolved and written once.

| Rule | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| Read and write, by the start of the name, with an optional leading dot, and anything inside a folder by such a name | `identity.DataSecrets` at the top: `hub.json`, `link.json`, `tailcat.json`, `tailcat-hub.json`, `daemons.json`, `manager.json`, `apns`, `relay.json`, `relay.secret`, `relay-tunnel.token`, `devices.json`, `mail_accounts.json` |
| Read and write, key and credential files with their backups | `identity.DataCredentialPattern` at the top: `\.(key|p8|pem|crt|token|secret|password)([.~-][^/]*)?$` |
| Read and write, whole folders | `identity.DataSecretDirs` (`launcher-settings/`, `tls/`, `link-tls/`, `docker/`, `extensions/data/`, `extensions/staging/`, `plugins/`, `node-plugins/`), and `managers/`, `extensions/run/`, `run/`; connecting to the sockets in `extensions/run/`, `plugins/run/` and `run/` |
| Connect | Unix sockets under `extensions/run/` and `run/` |
| Write | The data directory itself, every folder above it, its other names (the `~/.persona` link), every folder in it that holds a closed folder (`extensions/`), `agent-sandbox.on` |
| Allow read | This start's own files in `launcher-settings/` (what it passes with `--settings`) |

The node's path guard (`server/internal/node/pathguard.go`, which decides what a phone or web client may read by path)
takes the same list from `server/internal/identity/secrets.go`. They differ here, and `TestAgentSandboxCoversPathGuard`
pins each difference:

| Path in the data directory | Path guard | Agent sandbox |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `managers/<id>/` | The same names, keys and folders at its top | The whole folder |
| `.hub.json.*` and other dot-prefixed copies | Readable | Refused |
| `extensions/run/`, `run/` | Readable | Refused, sockets included |
| This start's own launcher settings | Refused | Readable |
| A manager's folder outside the data directory (`--dir`, one holding a manager's `manager.json`) | The same names, keys and folders at its top | Not closed |

Neither matches a name deeper in the data directory, so a project's own `link.json` or `certs/dev.pem` below it stays
readable.

## Known side effects

- **setuid programs do not start**: `ps`, `top`, `sudo`, `su` and `crontab` fail with `Operation not permitted`. `pgrep`
  and `lsof` work.
- **`personad launch`, `personad extension …` and `personad hub admin …` fail in an agent**: they read `launch.key` or
  the hub's token in `hub.json`.
- **Each wrapped start runs `sandbox-exec` once more**, with `/usr/bin/true`, to check the rules before the real start;
  it takes about 10 ms, and the node remembers the answer for the same rules.

## The switch is a file in the data directory

Turn it on or off for every process on the machine with the file, then start the agent again; running agents keep how
they started. Before you turn it on: it does not stop Docker (see "Some ways to the secrets stay open"), it does not
cover agents started in herdr or Orca without a managed launcher, and `ps`, `top` and `sudo` stop working in agents.
`personad node doctor` repeats all three while it is on.

```sh
touch ~/.persona/agent-sandbox.on   # on (use PERSONA_HOME's directory for a custom root)
rm ~/.persona/agent-sandbox.on      # off
```

`PERSONA_AGENT_SANDBOX` (`on` or `off`, also `1`, `0`, `true`, `false`) overrides the
file for the process that reads it. Each start reads it in a different place:

| Start | Reads the variable from |
| --- | --- |
| The assistant, CLI and Agent SDK | The node's environment: for the resident node, `EnvironmentVariables` in its LaunchAgent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.persona.node.plist`), read when the node restarts |
| `personad launch`, `personad codex-start` | The shell of the herdr or Orca pane (the node's, when the node checks a launcher) |
| `personad node doctor` | The terminal it runs in |

A `PERSONA_HOME` set only for the node does not reach a pane's shell, which then looks for the file in
`~/.persona`. Configure the same `PERSONA_HOME` in both the resident node's LaunchAgent and the pane's shell when using a custom root.

## When something breaks, turn it off and start again

1. Run `personad node doctor`. The `agent-sandbox` line says whether the sandbox is on, whether this Mac can run it,
   and the last result of each kind of start, with the reason when a start was not wrapped.
2. Remove `agent-sandbox.on`, or set `PERSONA_AGENT_SANDBOX=off` for one shell, and start the agent again. Nothing else
   changes: no data moves and no file is rewritten.

A start the sandbox cannot set up runs unwrapped: the agent starts as before, and the reason goes to the pane
(`personad launch: agent sandbox: … not wrapped`) or the node's log, and to `agent-sandbox-status.json` in the data
directory, which the doctor reads.

## Tests run only on a Mac

`TestDarwinAgentSandboxForReal` (`server/internal/extension/sandbox/agent_test.go`) runs shell commands under the real
profile in a fake data directory and checks both what must fail and what must work. CI has no macOS runner, so it runs
locally: `go test ./internal/extension/sandbox/ -run ForReal -v` in `server/`. Apple marks `sandbox-exec` deprecated and
does not document its profile language, so run this test after a macOS update.
