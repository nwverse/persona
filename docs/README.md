# Documentation

Start with [Getting started](operations/getting-started.md), [configuration](operations/config.md),
and the [architecture](server/architecture.md). The [protocol](protocol/protocol.md) is the client/server contract.

| [lessons/](lessons/README.md) | Reusable pitfalls and fixes, organized by topic | [Lessons index](lessons/README.md) |
| [archive/](archive/README.md) | Historical measurements, unfinished acceptance boundaries and superseded designs, grouped by module | [Archive index](archive/README.md) |

The complete maintained-guide index remains in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#docs-index).
Archive records are evidence from their stated date, not current instructions. Follow the maintained module guide when they disagree.

## Keeping this tree small

- Put a maintained guide in its module directory. Update repository-wide references and the index whenever it moves.
- Merge durable findings into the guide or a lesson. Keep a historical report only when it preserves unique measurements,
  unresolved acceptance limits, or decisions not recorded elsewhere; group it under `archive/<module>/`.
- Do not commit development screenshots, recordings, before/after mockups, or capture-only indexes.
  Save verification output outside the checkout and attach evidence to the relevant PR.
- Only README, app, or website production media belongs in git. App and website resources stay in their owning module;
  this documentation tree retains only the README assets. Interactive design prototypes are text, live beside their
  module guide (or in its archive), and do not depend on stored verification images.
- Run `python3 scripts/test/test_doc_paths.py`, `python3 scripts/test/test_doc_go_paths.py`, and
  `python3 scripts/test/test_readme_languages.py` after changing document or asset paths.
