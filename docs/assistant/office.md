# Generating Office files (`personad office`, #1300)

The command the assistant and Agents use to generate Word, PowerPoint and Excel files; it is M9 of #1289. The file is generated on that machine. When the reply contains its absolute path, the App shows it as a card under the reply
(a thumbnail of the first page, the file name, a type such as "Word document", #1543, see `docs/apple/ios.md` ("File viewer (2026-10-31)", **Images viewed this turn and document cards**)); tapping it opens the M1–M3 preview.
The assistant and Agents started by Persona use it through the skill `persona-office` (see "skill" below).

## Why it lives in personad

The hub machine that runs the assistant does not necessarily have Node, pip / venv or LibreOffice (observed: Ubuntu lacks `ensurepip`, and Claude Code is a native binary).
Approaches that depend on python-docx / python-pptx (lxml, which needs compiling) or Node's docx / pptxgenjs do not run there, and the environments on the various computers are not complete either.
Every machine has `personad`, so the generator lives in it (`server/internal/office`). Go has no mature docx / pptx library with a suitable license, so we write minimal valid Office Open XML ourselves;
Markdown is parsed with goldmark (MIT). We borrowed ideas from Anthropic's official docx / xlsx / pptx skills (self-check after writing, formulas in tables, consistent layout): only the ideas, no content was copied.

## skill (persona-office)

Built-in skill `server/internal/assistantskills/builtin/persona-office`: SKILL.md says when to use it, how to write the source file, to look at `check` after generating, and to write the file's absolute path in the reply.
The skill's own `office.sh` finds the local personad (first `PERSONA_BIN`, then `~/.persona/bin`, `~/.persona/bin`, `/opt/persona/bin`, finally PATH; if none, exit code 3).

Who gets it (decided by the user 2026-11-04): **only the assistant and Agents started by Persona**. It is not written into the machine's user-level Claude / Codex skills directories, so sessions the user opens themselves are unaffected.

- Assistant: installed into its directory like the other built-in skills (`assistantskills.Sync`: `.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`; the Codex assistant via extraRoots).
- Claude Agents started by Persona: when node starts, it writes the skills as a plugin (`<node dir>/agent-plugin`, `assistantskills.WritePlugin`; `ForAgents` lists the ones for Agents),
  and the launch command adds `--plugin-dir`. Like `--mcp-config` and Persona's hooks plugin, it applies only to that one session. Inside the session it is called `persona:persona-office`.
  - Added only for Claude Code 2.1 and later (`pluginMinVersion`): older versions reject unknown flags and the whole launch fails. If the version cannot be queried, it is not added either and the launch proceeds as before.
  - The version is queried once on every hello; at launch it is queried again only if more than 10 minutes have passed (each query starts a login shell).
- Codex Agents started by Persona: not included yet. We have not found a way to add a skills directory per session for Codex without writing `CODEX_HOME/skills`.

### No approval every time

The generate command does not pop an approval card on the user's phone: when Persona starts claude, it allows this one command with `--allowedTools`, matching only the absolute path and valid only for that session.
- Agents started by Persona: `Bash(sh <node dir>/agent-plugin/skills/persona-office/scripts/office.sh *)`, added together with the `--plugin-dir` that loads the plugin (Claude Code 2.1 and later).
- Assistant: the same rule for `.claude/skills/persona-office/scripts/office.sh` in its directory, appended after its existing `--allowedTools mcp__persona`.
- Not written into any settings file. Sessions the user opens themselves are unaffected, and the launcher's own `--settings` still applies (since #1462 Persona only passes `--settings` to managed launchers).

Why it works this way (tried on real claude on 2026-11-04):
- Not the skill's `allowed-tools`: with it, invoking the skill itself needs approval (rejected outright under `-p`), and rules hard-coded in SKILL.md cannot carry each machine's paths.
- Not a wildcard like `*/persona-office/scripts/office.sh`: an Agent could write a same-named script in its own directory (no prompt under acceptEdits) and it would be allowed. We tried it and it really ran. Matching only the absolute path blocks this.
- Not written into Persona's settings file: since #1462 most launches no longer pass it.
- Claude Code splits commands chained with `;` or `&&` and checks each one; files under `.claude/` are not modified without asking either. So the assistant's copy of the script cannot be swapped silently.
- `-o` can only write files of the same kind (`.docx` / `.pptx` / `.xlsx`), so one allowed command cannot overwrite files like `~/.zshrc`.
- That is why SKILL.md requires one file per command and the script's absolute path written out, not assembled from shell variables.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `personad office docx <file.md> [-o out.docx] [--title T]` | Word document, A4 |
| `personad office pptx <file.md> [-o out.pptx] [--title T]` | 16:9 presentation |
| `personad office xlsx <file.json\|file.csv> [-o out.xlsx]` | Excel workbook |
| `personad office check <file.docx\|.xlsx\|.pptx>` | Reads the structure back, ours or anyone else's |

- Without `-o`, the output goes next to the input with the matching extension. After writing, it prints JSON: `file` (absolute path), `bytes`, `check` (same as the check result).
- It never writes over its input and takes no Office file as input (`docx notes.docx`, or `-o` naming the input by any path, exits 2). It replaces the output in one step (a temporary file beside it, renamed over it), so a failed write leaves the earlier file as it was. A link at `-o` is replaced, not written through.
- Exit codes: 0 success, 1 failure (one line of reason on stderr, e.g. image not found), 2 bad usage.

## What to write

**docx (Markdown)**:
- Supported: `#` to `###` headings (deeper ones count as level three), paragraphs, **bold** / *italic* / `code` / ~~strikethrough~~ / links, ordered and unordered lists (nestable; an ordered list starts from its own first number), GitHub tables (first row is the header, column alignment follows `:---:`), code blocks, quotes, task-list checkboxes, `---` (page break).
- Images `![caption](path relative to the Markdown file)`: PNG / JPEG / GIF only, scaled at most to the page width. Remote images are not downloaded; only the caption text is kept.

**pptx (Markdown)**:
- Slides: if there is `---`, split on it; otherwise each `#` / `##` heading starts a slide. The first heading on a slide is its title.
- Cover: if the first slide has only a `#` heading and paragraphs, it becomes a cover, with the paragraphs as subtitle.
- Body: lists are bullet points (numbered lists keep their numbers); other paragraphs are lines without bullets.
- Images and tables: one image and one table per slide (later ones are left out). With text, the image goes on the right and the table below. With both, the picture is on the right and the words and the table share the left column.
- Font size: shrinks automatically with the amount of text on the slide (24 → 20 → 18 → 14 pt). Many viewers do not auto-shrink text the way PowerPoint does while editing.

**xlsx (JSON or CSV)**:

```json
{"sheets":[{"name":"Sales","header":["Month","Revenue","Date"],
  "rows":[["Jan",1200.5,"2026-01-31"],["Total","=SUM(B2:B2)",null]],
  "widths":[10,14,12],"formats":["","#,##0.00","yyyy-mm-dd"],"freeze":true}]}
```

- Cells: text, numbers, `true` / `false`, `null` (empty), or a formula starting with `=`.
- The header is bold, with a light background, and frozen (`freeze: false` turns that off). Column widths default to the content; a CJK character counts as two characters wide.
- `formats` are per-column Excel number formats. When a format looks like a date (contains `yy`, `dd` or `mmm`), text like `"2026-01-31"` becomes a real date.
- The 1900 date system starts at `1900-01-01`; earlier or invalid date strings stay text.
- Sheet names have characters Excel rejects removed, are truncated to 31 characters, and duplicates get a sequence number.
- Excel's limits: 32,767 characters of text in a cell (counted in UTF-16 as Excel does, so most emoji count two), 8,192 characters in a formula after its `=`, 16,384 columns (A to XFD) and 1,048,576 rows with the header. Past them the command writes nothing and names the sheet and the cell or row count (`sheet "Data": A1: 40000 characters, an Excel cell holds at most 32767`) rather than leave Excel to truncate or drop data; this applies to CSV too. Text that `&` joins past a cell's limit is `#VALUE!`, as in Excel.
- CSV: the first row is the header. Numeric-looking fields become numbers when the workbook keeps their value: integers such as long IDs must survive exactly, while decimals and exponents may round to the 15 significant digits a spreadsheet keeps (a float written as `0.30000000000000004` becomes `0.3`). IDs with leading zeros such as `007`, non-finite values, integers that would lose digits and decimals that would change further (underflow, subnormals) stay as their original text.
  Text that starts with `=` stays text, header included (an exported `=HYPERLINK(…)` must not run when the file opens); write formulas in the JSON form.

## Formula values

Formulas in the workbook are computed at write time and their values written into the file, like Excel does on save (`formula.go`). Many viewers (QuickLook, the App's preview, many web viewers) do not compute formulas; they only show the stored value, and with no value the cell is blank.
Excel and Numbers still recompute everything on open (`fullCalcOnLoad`).

- Supported: `+ - * / ^ & %`, comparisons, cells and ranges (other sheets too: `Sheet!A1`, `'with space'!A1:B2`), and SUM AVERAGE MIN MAX COUNT COUNTA ROUND ABS IF IFERROR AND OR NOT.
  `ROUND` follows Excel's 15 significant digits: `2.345` rounds to `2.35`.
  Arguments are read as Excel reads them: SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX and COUNT take only the numbers of a reference; typed-in
  arguments also count when they are `TRUE` / `FALSE` or text that reads as a number. AND and OR skip a reference's blanks
  and text (`#VALUE!` when nothing is left to judge).
- When another function appears (VLOOKUP etc.), that formula gets no value and is left for Excel to compute; it will be blank in viewers that do not compute formulas.
- Circular references are written as `#REF!`.

## How it was verified

- Unit tests in `server/internal/office`: every part's XML is valid; content, numbering, images, tables and formula values are all present; check can read them back.
- Synthetic samples cross-checked on macOS (2026-11-04):
  - QuickLook thumbnails: documents, every kind of slide, and workbook formula values all display correctly.
  - `textutil` reads the docx.
  - python-docx / openpyxl / python-pptx open them without errors and read the headings, tables, images, freeze, number formats, dates and cached formula values.
- Worked around several QuickLook limitations:
  - Table borders and widths are written on the table itself, not only in the style.
  - One numbering definition per ordered list, no `startOverride`.
  - Page breaks use "page break before" on the next paragraph, not a break character: QuickLook shows a break character as a box.
- QuickLook still shrinks table column widths to fit the content; in Word they span the full page width.
