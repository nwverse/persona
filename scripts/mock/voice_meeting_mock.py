"""MOCK_VOICE's meeting calls (#3862 phase 4, docs/assistant/meeting-minutes.md "Phase 4: realtime voice in the meeting";
docs/assistant/voice.md "App → extension"): the voice extension's `meeting` feature on the protocol 2 socket of
voice_mock.py, against mock_hub.py's own meeting state (its rooms, MEETING_CONV). voice_mock.py loads it in `install`;
everything here is made up.

  GET …/voice/info, ready          `meeting` in the features (MOCK_VOICE_MEETING=off, or GET /mock/voice_meeting?meeting=off:
                                   an extension from before phase 4, which knows neither the mode nor the refusal below)
  start {"mode": "meeting"}        a meeting call: protocol 2, `recording_id` and `target` naming that recording's room,
                                   which must be `ready` (as the extension reads GET …/live); anything else is the fatal
                                   error not_meeting_room. `echo_cancellation` is logged
  start without the mode           a protocol 2 start bound to a room (origin meeting) is the fatal error meeting_room
  {"type":"talk","on":true|false}  a Talk span. Audio frames are counted inside and outside spans; one outside a span is
                                   what the extension replaces by silence (logged once per run of them). After `talk off`
                                   with audio in the span the call answers by script: the user's caption (partial, final),
                                   the question handed to the room as a run (sending → sent → working → done), the
                                   question and the room's answer in the room's thread, the answer as a caption and 24 kHz
                                   silence as its audio. An empty span is answered by nothing; a talk frame without `on`
                                   is off, one whose `on` is not a bool changes nothing. Talk frames in an ordinary call
                                   are ignored (voice_mock.py counts them as talks_ignored)
  text                             a typed question: the same script from its caption on
  GET /mock/voice_meeting          what the app sent to meeting calls: their starts (the newest as `start`), the
                                   refusals, the talk frames and spans, audio frames inside and outside spans, the questions
                                   answered; ?reset=1 forgets them, ?meeting=on|off switches the feature
A meeting call never pauses its upstream (no link paused: decision 7 keeps it connected for the whole meeting) and
never ends after idle minutes. The pace is voice_mock.py's (MOCK_VOICE_PACE).
