"""Check a shrunk release APK for code reached by name (docs/android/android.md, "Release shrinking").

    check_android_shrink.py <release apk> <R8 mapping directory> [--build-tools <dir>]

R8 keeps only what code references. Android also reaches classes by name: manifest components, App Startup
initializers, WorkManager workers (rebuilt from their class name with a (Context, WorkerParameters) constructor), Room
databases (whose generated <name>_Impl is loaded by name), JavaScript bridge methods, the getters the tasks store
looks up on a hub failure and the SSH tunnel's algorithms, which JSch makes from class names. Error reports and breadcrumbs print simple class names, which come from InnerClass
annotations, and the class names themselves, which class merging would replace: every class a keep rule listed in
R8's seeds.txt must still be in the dex or be listed as removed in usage.txt, and every Throwable in the dex must be
listed there (proguard-rules.pro keeps all their names). This reads the merged manifest with aapt2 and every
classes*.dex directly, and exits 1 with one line per problem when anything is missing, so a release stops before
signing.

It also fails when any method grows past what ART compiles: ART leaves methods over 10,000 code units
interpreted. Every method counts, the libraries' too, because R8 merges classes across packages and the class holding
a method says nothing about who wrote it; one over the limit fails unless KNOWN_OVERSIZED lists it, a listed one fails
when it grows past the size recorded there, and one between 9,000 and 10,000 only warns so the next split happens
before the limit. Methods are named by their whole signature, `Class.method(descriptor)`, so an overload is judged on
its own size. A listed method now at or under the limit (or gone from the dex) is only noted, so the list shrinks to
empty.
