/**
 * Owned by the paired hub scope, never by a settings screen or an Activity.
 *
 * Calls are received concurrently: a confirmed write waiting for the user does not stop later calls (reads
 * included) from being accepted and executed. A bounded [Semaphore] caps how many calls are in flight so a
 * flood of calls still applies back-pressure to the transport queue. A confirmed write whose local execution
 * has started is no longer killed by the enabled / permission / visibility watcher: it must produce a definite
 * result or failure, which is then delivered via [PhoneToolResultOutbox] if the socket cannot take it.
