/**
 * [this] row with what a summary row leaves out taken from [old], the same session's row held before (iOS
 * `preservingDetails`; docs/protocol/protocol.md "Summary rows"): a summary (one with `waiting`) carries the list's
 * fields and a Persona chat's `model_pick`, but not the launcher, the permission mode, the compaction, the waiting
 * launcher switch and the other chat-only details. Without them the model pill would read "Following the default" while
 * the hub runs the chat's own pick on its launcher. A complete row, or no row held, is taken as it is; what the summary
 * does carry (the model, the effort, `model_pick`) is the summary's.
