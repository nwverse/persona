 * exist yet has no tasks, files or folder, so @ lists the other agents' sessions, every computer's, most recently active
 * first, and a typed absolute or `~` path lists that folder on the assistant's computer ([starterMentionSource]). A
 * picked session waits over the composer as a quote card ([StarterQuoteCards]) and goes in front of the first message
 * as a `<persona-context>` tag, as in a chat ([message]).
