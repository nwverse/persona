/**
 * The AI twin's work on an item, in its row and on its page: busy or failed as a status line, and an AI draft (the AI
 * twin's, or one from "AI draft") as a card with "Revise" and "Send". "Send" always asks first ("Send as you?"), where it
 * goes and the whole text (the old app's ConfirmSend). [onEdit] / [onSend] let a page use its own sheet and send path
 * (the mail page checks the newest message); by default the card opens [InboxDraftSheet] and sends to the item.
