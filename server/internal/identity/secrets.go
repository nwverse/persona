// agent's own processes open) and `personad hub doctor` (hub/doctor.go: the modes the credential files are kept in).
// The guard and the sandbox match them where they are written, at the top of the data directory (the path guard also
// at the top of a manager's folder, managers/<id>/, which the sandbox closes whole, and of a manager's folder
// anywhere, one holding a manager's manager.json); docs/server/agent-sandbox.md "Which files" says where the two
