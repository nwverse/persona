// The unified inbox (docs/assistant/inbox.md) is the assistant's (internal/assistant's inbox*.go; "the manager" in the
// comments below): the items and their state, triage, events, mutes, the AI double, translations and the
// /api/v1/inbox… routes, which the hub relays to the manager process. The sources are this code's, the extension
// manager in that same process: it reads them when a round is due — its poll, a connector's changed, a pull to refresh
// the assistant asks for (inbox.collect) — and hands what it read to the assistant in-process (inbox.collected through
// callAssistant); it answers what the inbox asks of the sources and of its other parts (app.call inbox.*:
// inboxAppCall, reached through the bus connection's localAppCall, never the hub), and tells the extensions and,
// through the hub's broadcast, the apps when items changed (inbox.changed, taken here by AssistantSaid). It keeps no
// inbox state of its own: while the assistant can't take a round (there is none yet, or it refused or failed the
// hand-over) the sources are still read on schedule and what they had is kept for it (merged, bounded, in memory:
// heldThingsMost, heldMailMost), so what leaves a source's window meanwhile (mail's newest 40, iMessage's newest 30) is
// not lost; what was kept goes with the first round it takes again, and a full round still owed at the next wake-up.
