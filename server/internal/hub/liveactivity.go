// The "Fleet" Live Activity (docs/apple/live-activity.md): one activity per phone, on the lock screen and in the Dynamic
// Island, summing up every agent that needs you, is working, or finished unseen. The hub computes the state
// (FleetState, the activity's ContentState) from what it already knows and pushes it over APNs (push type
// liveactivity) to each device's activity token; push-to-start opens one when the app is not running.
//
// Budget: Apple throttles activity updates (numbers unpublished), and each one redraws the island and the lock screen
// on the phone. So what needs the user (a request arriving, or answered) goes out at once; anything else is merged
// for fleetCoalesce and reaches a device at most every fleetMinGap; the timer (working since…) runs on the phone; a
// phone whose app is open draws the activity itself from the fleet events and gets no push; and nothing is sent
// while nothing changes except a refresh before the content goes stale (docs/apple/live-activity.md "Push cadence").
