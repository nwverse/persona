// Group. While the app is open it writes on every change; when it is not, the hub wakes it with a silent push
// (wakeDevices "widgets", the push the phone_* tools use) when what the widgets count changes, and the app writes again.
// Background pushes are budgeted by iOS (a few an hour) and never reach an app the user force-quit, so:
//   - only devices that said they have widgets (NotifyPrefs.Widgets) and whose app is not open (phoneOpen);
//   - a change to Needs You goes at once; any other change of the counts at most once every widgetGap a device;
//   - with nothing changed, one wake a widgetHeartbeat, so a widget on a calm day is not shown as out of date (the
//     app's HomeSnapshot.staleAfter is an hour);
//   - a member hub's devices are the center's, as for the Live Activity (mesh_group.go).
