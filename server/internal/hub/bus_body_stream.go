// A large request body goes to the manager on a relay stream of its own (#6574). Inside the http.request line it
// held up every other call on the bus until it was written: the bus is one WebSocket, one message at a time, and a
// message goes out as one frame. On a slow link the keepalive's ping, which waits at most 5 s for that frame, failed
// and the bus dropped with every call on it.
//
// The request itself still goes on the bus (http.request_streamed: the same params without the body, plus the
// relay's id and the body's size), and so does the answer: everything but the body's bytes travels as before. The
// manager dials the relay, reads exactly that many bytes, and only then serves the request as http.request does.

// bodyStreamMin is the smallest body the hub sends on a stream of its own: below it, the relay's extra round trip
// costs more than the bus is held up.
