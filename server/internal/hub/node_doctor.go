// so both routes are for a full device alone; an answer-only device and the tokens an extension holds are refused
// before the node hears of it. GET only reads: the hub never sends fix to node.doctor, so a query string cannot ask
// for a write. The old node that does not know the method answers "unknown method", which the web turns into "Update node".
