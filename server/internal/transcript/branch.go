// Claude Code's transcript is a tree: every line has a uuid and a parentUuid. A conversation is mostly one chain, but
// going back to an earlier message (/rewind, editing a sent message with ↑) writes the next message as a second child
// of the line before the one it replaces. The file is only ever appended to, so the turns that were gone back over
// stay in it, and a reader that takes the lines in order shows both. Claude itself continues from the last line
// written.
//
// What is followed here is the narrowest thing that identifies this: two of the user's own messages hanging from the
// same parent, the earlier one having been answered (an assistant line grew from it). That one, and everything that
// grew from it, is an abandoned branch and is left out of the items (the later one may itself be abandoned by a
// third). An earlier message nothing answered is not one: pressing Esc on a message that has no reply yet and sending
// it again (or another) writes the same two siblings, and there is nothing that was gone back over — hiding it made the
// history token move for no reason and cut the interrupted turn from the chat (#3036); the terminal shows it, so
// does the chat. Other forks are ordinary — parallel tool results, an attachment beside a reply, a hook's line — and a
// compaction starts a new chain (parentUuid null) on purpose, so the walk back from the last line, which is what a
// resume does, would lose them: it is not used.
//
// A rewind done in the terminal writes nothing either, and the next line Claude writes need not be a message: after a
// while away it writes a recap (system away_summary) hanging from where the user went back to, and that may be all the
// file says for hours. So a system line is taken for going back too, more narrowly: it has to hang beside one of the
// user's messages that was answered and whose turn ended (a turn_duration line grew from it). A system line written
// with the parent it had before a message came in (a recap worked out while the user typed) then leaves a turn still
// going alone. Across the recorded transcripts (about 19.7k, 2026-11-06) a system line beside an answered message
// turned up once, and that was a rewind; beside a message nothing answered it turned up too (#3036's case: kept).
// The message the user sent next in that transcript hung from the recap, not from where they went back to: without
// the system line, the rewind would not have been seen even then.
//
// Clients hold items they were already sent. A branch is abandoned when the next message or system line is written (or
// when the node itself rewound, File.Rewound), so the history token (Span.History) carries how many abandoned branches the file has:
// it changes then, and a client that sees it change starts over (docs/protocol/protocol.md "Continuity of items"), as it does for a
// file that was rewritten. The token is a function of the file, so it is the same across node restarts.
