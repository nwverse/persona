// Cards by voice (docs/assistant/voice.md "Questions and cards"). The cards waiting in the conversation the call follows — the one it is
// bound to (protocol 2), else one a run waits on (protocol 1: the main conversation) — are read from the hub when the
// hub link says one came or went (interaction, interaction_resolved, a conversation's pending count) and every
// lookEvery:
//   - a question voice can answer (kind question, with its questions, no fields, no secret) is asked, a card at a time,
//     the oldest first, a question at a time, its options by their names (voice/ask). While it is asked, what the model
//     hands over is the answer (but "Status:" and "Stop:"): an option's number, ordinal or name, else the words
//     themselves (channel.ReadAnswer, MatchOption); once its last question is answered the card is resolved, in the
//     background (a Codex card waits for its node to type the answer). 404, 410, a 200 that says already and a 409
//     prompt_changed are an answer given elsewhere first; another 409 (a node's refusal: a draft in the box, another
//     dialog open) is one only when the card is gone, else the question is asked on;
//   - any other card (a plan, a permission, a terminal dialog, a form) is only said, by its kind (voice/needs_you): it
//     is tapped on the screen (decision 5), and a spoken "approve" is not sent (send.go, on_screen);
//   - a card answered elsewhere while it is asked is confirmed in a sentence (voice/answered); one not asked yet goes
//     without a word.
// Only a full device answers cards by voice (docs/assistant/voice.md "Permissions"): another extension's call keeps the turn's
// "check on the phone" (voice/report needs_you). The tracker's goroutine owns all this, from the moment the call is set up
// (arm: the tracker runs from the app's socket on, before its start is read). The conversation keeps which card the
// model was told it asks (askCur, askTold): what the model hands over is that card's answer only once it heard the
