// Meeting calls (#3862 phase 4; docs/assistant/meeting-minutes.md "Phase 4: realtime voice in the meeting",
// docs/assistant/voice.md "Meeting calls"). The iPhone holds one call for a whole meeting, on the recorder's own capture,
// bound to the meeting's room conversation: a protocol 2 start with mode "meeting", the recording and the room as its
// target. The room is checked with the hub first (GET …/live: that recording's room, ready), and a room takes no other
// call (meeting_room): an ordinary call would bring search_knowledge and list_agents in front of the room.
//
// Everyone in the room may hear the fast layer, so it is told only the owner's name and the language (voice/meeting:
// never their notes), its only tool is delegate_task, which hands the question to the room, and its snapshot is the
// room's own last questions and answers, read from the room (never the app's recent, which may hold lines the room
// must not know). It says only what it handed over: the room's other turns (batches, heard asks, photos) are not
// followed, and the upstream never pauses (the meeting goes on for an hour, and a wake would cost the first words of
// the next Talk).
//
// The model hears only Talk: the app sends talk{on} and talk{off} around what the owner says to it, and between those
// spans the extension feeds the upstream silence itself, so the session stays open and the model hears nothing. The
// app is not trusted with that: its audio outside a span is dropped and logged, and the silence goes in its place, and
// a span it leaves open past talkMost is closed, so a phone bug cannot stream the meeting to the voice service.
//
// What it hands the room goes as the owner's words, so the user-speech gate (gate.go) always holds: only what the owner
// just said in Talk, or typed, opens it. A start's speech_gate (#5904) neither turns it off nor brings Send Anyway: a
// question the gate held back is not kept for a resend (the meeting page has no such button), and the owner says it
// again in the next Talk.
