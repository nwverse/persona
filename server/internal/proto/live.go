// SessionLive is what a working Claude's status line says right now ("✻ Frosting… (16m 15s · ↓ 22.8k tokens ·
// thinking with xhigh effort)"): the node reads it off the pane about once a second while a client watches the
// session and sends it as the notification "session.live" {session_id, live}; the hub passes it to the session's
// subscribers that asked for the feature "session_live" as {type: "live", machine_id, session_id, live}. A nil
// live means the turn is over or the line is gone (docs/protocol/protocol.md "Live status").
