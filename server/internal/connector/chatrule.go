// Per-chat rules (#5278): from a row of the sent-as-user ledger the user can say "don't ask again in this chat", which
// adds a rule that lets writes into that one chat through without a card. The rules are the gate's own (Rule), made
// by ChatRuleFor from what the row says and never from anything the user typed, and checked again by UserRule.Validate
// wherever they are loaded or applied: a user's rule only allows, and only into one chat. They are kept by the
// manager (extmgr) and set on the Registry (SetUserRules), after the hand-written connector_gate rules, so a
// hand-written deny or confirm that matches still wins; ConfirmAlways and a health conversation still clamp an allow
// to a card, as for any other rule.
//
// What "one chat" is, per connector (the shapes below are the only ones there are):
//
//   - Lark: the messages of one conversation, `POST /conversations/<id>/messages` ("<METHOD> <path>", how the
//     node's gate reads a call: without the gate's path prefix and the query). The id is a path segment the node
//     compares literally, so a pattern cannot stand in for it, and one with a pattern character is refused. The rule
//     is the route and the conversation: what the body says is not matched (a text may mention people, or quote a
//     message, as a confirmed one could). Not covered, and so still asked: a reply (`POST /messages/<id>/replies`
//     names no conversation), images, files and attachments (a file leaves the computer, which a row that said text
//     did not allow), edits, reactions and everything else of a conversation.
//   - GitHub: `github_comment` on one repository and issue or pull request number: Match {repo, number}, the
//     argument fields the gate sees (the tool's own, prompts/mcp/github). A review is another action and stays asked.
//
// Mail, an extension's own record (sent.record) and any connector this file does not know have no one-chat shape:
// ChatRuleFor says so with a reason.

// githubConnector and githubComment are the GitHub connector's id and its action that comments on an issue or a pull
