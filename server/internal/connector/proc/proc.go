// Package proc is a connector that runs in a program of its own and answers for it in the hub. It
// implements every capability and declares what the program said it has (a proxy's manifest): the hub uses only
// those. The program is either a plugin's, run by the plugin host (Config.Link: the hub's way, docs/extensions/extensions.md), or
// started here with the connector protocol's own opening (Config.Path), which only this package's tests still do.
// Connector extensions such as Telegram (#1704) run the first way, outside personad for their dependencies
// (docs/archive/extensions/plan-telegram.md).
