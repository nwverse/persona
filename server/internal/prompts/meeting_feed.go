// MeetingFeed is one batch of a recorded meeting for the session that attends it (meeting/feed,
// docs/assistant/meeting-minutes.md "Feeding the attending session"): a short line saying what it is, then the live
// lines and the questions answered on the phone since the last batch in a context block. Every text goes in through
// ctx, so a line someone said cannot close the block; Title is the meeting's name on one line.
