Review a task you handed out from this conversation (its todo id), after you checked its work yourself: each done_when criterion with its evidence (a PR link and that it merged, CI, a screenshot, what the live system answers) or what is missing. accepted closes the task (its agent is closed once it stays still); rework sends what is missing back to the same agent (resumed if it was closed) — at most 2 rounds, a third goes to the user instead; needs_user marks it waiting for the user's decision (its conclusion card asks them; without one, ask them yourself: ask_user, or notify_user if they are away, as the answer says); cancelled ends it (a duplicate, no longer wanted). From a conversation other than the main one, on a task it does not supervise, only accepted and cancelled apply: send what is missing to its agent with agent_send. Use it on every task a 督办 message says waits for review; don't accept on the agent's word alone. On a supervised task, accepted and needs_user send the user one conclusion card in Lark: the verdict (done, cannot be done, or needs your decision), reason (one sentence), link (one), and for needs_user your recommend, which the user takes by answering "OK"; so give outcome, reason and link with accepted, and reason and recommend with needs_user, and don't push the same result again. A needs_user decision may carry a deadline: when it passes unanswered, a reversible one takes your recommend by default (recorded on the to-do as taken at the deadline), and one that cannot be undone is only reminded again; without a deadline it waits as before.
