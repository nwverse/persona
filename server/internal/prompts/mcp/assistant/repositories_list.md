Search this assistant's saved repository references to resolve repository identity when a request is ambiguous. Search names, aliases, full repository paths and purposes; use repository_get for details only when useful. An explicit repository URL or path supplied by the user takes precedence. These bindings are references, not authorization or an allowlist; never infer a machine or local checkout path from a remote reference. Returns only saved metadata and verified_at, without remote checks, source fetching, cloning or permission checks. Non-repository tasks do not need a lookup. This guidance is not a mandatory dispatch preflight.

```json

  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "query": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 200, "description": "Optional case-insensitive substring of a saved name, alias, full path or purpose; omit to browse. Preserve explicit user repository choices."},
    "cursor": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 1024, "description": "Opaque next_cursor from this assistant's previous page with the same query. Restart without it if the saved references changed."},
    "limit": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 50, "description": "Results per page, default 20; at most 50."}
  }
