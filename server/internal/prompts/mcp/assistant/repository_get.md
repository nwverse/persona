Read one saved repository reference belonging to the current assistant, using its id from repositories_list. Returns provider, instance, full path, canonical URL, optional name/aliases/purpose and verified_at from saved metadata only. Use details only when useful to resolve repository context. An explicit repository URL or path supplied by the user takes precedence. A binding is a reference, not authorization or an allowlist; never infer a machine or local checkout path from it. Does not check the remote, read source, clone, expose credentials or establish permissions.

  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["id"],
  "properties": {
    "id": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1, "maxLength": 80, "description": "Stable saved binding id returned by this assistant's repositories_list, not a URL, machine, path or another assistant's id."}
  }
}
