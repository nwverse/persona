Import a user-requested skill ZIP through Persona's existing Settings importer. First preview the base64-encoded archive (up to 4 MiB compressed); returns validated metadata, a short-lived reference and environment. Then install with the same archive, reference and environment. Installation and undo wait for the user's own permission card showing the validated skill and target computer; never approve for the user. The target is the current assistant's configured personal computer, never a model-chosen path or machine. Skills are shared by assistants using that computer account and load in new conversations; an existing conversation is not guaranteed to refresh. Same-name skills are never overwritten. ZIP inspection does not run scripts or treat skill instructions as authorization. Use status with the original reference and environment after a lost/uncertain response, before any retry: it records previewed, installed or undone and recovers the undo receipt. Status is an operation receipt, not a live inventory; receipts expire after ten minutes or a computer restart. If unavailable, inspect Settings > Skills instead of assuming failure. Cancel discards an unused preview. Undo takes an installed receipt, refuses edited/replaced files and retains recovery data. No URL download, repository clone, arbitrary path write or arbitrary skill removal is provided. An older computer may require a Persona update.
