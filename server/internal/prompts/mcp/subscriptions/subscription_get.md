Read one subscription in full: its whole recipe (mode, tool, args, items_path, fields, kind, group_by) and where it came from, its schedule, destinations, triage rules, fallback tier, state and error, the shape of the last result, its newest runs (newest first: when, how long, trigger, new and total items, `baseline` items recorded without delivering, error) and its newest held items as samples (title, sender, time, thread, link, the body cut to 300 characters). Use it before changing a subscription, for its revision and current values.
