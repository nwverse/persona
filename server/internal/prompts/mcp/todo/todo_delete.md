Delete one of the user's Persona to-dos for good (its notes, links to agents and decisions go with it), only when the user asks for it to be deleted; one that is finished is completed instead (todo_complete). Every delete is confirmed on the phone first; if the user declines, writes instead, or does not answer, nothing is deleted. The agents that worked on it are left as they are.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id"],
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "the to-do's id (todo_…), as todo_list gives it"
    }
  }
}
```
