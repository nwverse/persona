Add a to-do to the user's Persona to-dos, when the user asks you to note something to do or to remind them of it (or agrees to your suggestion): it shows on the To-dos page of the app, sorted by its due date, and with remind set the phone is pushed about it at that time. It is the user's own to-do, with no agent on it: work for an agent is task_plan. Done at once, nothing to confirm. An open to-do with the same title and due date is not made twice: you get that one back. Write the title as the thing to do (short, the user's language); put links, amounts and details in notes. Read due dates and times in the user's time zone; when only the day is known, give the day.
