Add a saved repository reference to the current assistant when the user asks. Accepts the same GitHub/GitLab URLs and metadata as Settings > Repositories, checks existence through the existing guarded metadata service, and refuses duplicates or concurrent changes. Shows the normalized repository and details in a permission card; only the user's own approval saves it. Returns the saved binding with id and verified_at. This is a reference, not authorization or an allowlist: it does not clone, fetch source, grant permissions, or establish a machine or local checkout. Credentials in URLs are refused. If the response is lost or saving is uncertain, use repositories_list/repository_get before retrying. Remove the reference in Settings > Repositories to reverse the addition.
