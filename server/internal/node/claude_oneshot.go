// A program running Claude Code's command line once (`claude -p`: entrypoint "sdk-cli") writes a transcript like any
// session's; a script doing it all day filled the offline list with them and pushed the user's own sessions out of its 80
// (#3828). The offline list leaves out a transcript that is such a run from its first entrypoint to its last (the first
// read within oneShotHead of the start, the last within oneShotReach of the end): a session the user had in a terminal
// and then went on with through `claude -p -c`, or the other way round, is listed. So is everything Persona has a hand
// in: whatever was started under its state directory (the assistant's, any manager's, a health space's, a guest's; its
// path and its resolved one), a session the node keeps state for (none is left out while that state still loads), a
// fork, a kept session. The Agent SDKs' runs ("sdk-ts", "sdk-py") are listed: interactive hosts such as Paseo run the
// user's sessions through them. Codex's one-shot runs are left out the same way (codex_hierarchy.go programRun).

// oneShotTail is how much of a transcript's end is read first for its last entrypoint: Claude Code writes one near the
// end of every message's line. After the last message it writes lines that carry none (api-request-blob, api-request,
// last-prompt, mode, atis-latch: 14 KB after a `claude -p` run's last message on one Mac, Claude Code 2.1.32x), so the
// window doubles until one shows up, as far as oneShotReach. The first is looked for from the start, a tail's worth at
// a time up to oneShotHead: a program's first line is its prompt, often longer than a tail (up to 19 KB on one Mac).
