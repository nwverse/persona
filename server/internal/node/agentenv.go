// An Agent the node starts runs in a pane, with its engine's environment and not the node's: herdr's server keeps the
// node's PERSONA_HOME only when the node started it (herdrServerKeep), and Orca's app runs with whatever environment
// it was started from. So what the node types into a pane says itself which data directory, and so which node, the
// Agent belongs to, and leaves out what only the assistant's processes are given: an engine started from the
// assistant's Bash tool would otherwise hand the assistant's environment to every Agent in it (#744). The files the
// node generates for its Agents (mcp.json, the hooks: generatedFiles) name the directory too, for a shell that takes
// neither.

// assistantOnlyEnv is what an Agent never takes over from its pane: what the node gives the assistant's processes alone
// (assistant_start.go, assistant_codex_spawn.go, assistant_mcp.go, assistant_guest.go, larkgate_env.go), and what a
// running Claude Code sets for every program it runs, marking it as that Claude's. The older spelling of each Persona
// variable goes too (assistantOnlyEnvNames). An Agent that wants CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW or ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH
// gets them from its launcher or Claude Code's settings, not from the pane.
