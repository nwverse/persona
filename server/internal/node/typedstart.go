// A start types its command into a fresh pane a moment after the tab is made, often before the shell's line editor
// has taken the terminal: until then the tty is in canonical mode, whose line limit is 1024 bytes on macOS
// (MAX_CANON), and herdr refuses a longer line up front (pane_send_failed). The whole command — the unset of the
// assistant's environment, PERSONA_HOME, HERDR_AGENT, a managed launcher's flags, the first message — is often longer
// (#2022). herdr-core pastes it into the same canonical tty. So in a herdr or herdr-core pane whose shell can source a
// file, the node writes the command to a file only the user can read and types `. <file>`: the shell runs the same
// command as if typed (a launcher that is an alias or a function still works), and the file removes itself first.
// Other hosts get the command typed as before.
