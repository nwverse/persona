// The command gates' credentials stay in the node (#1317). An assistant process gets, for a gate with Auth, its
// BaseEnv pointing at this proxy (http://127.0.0.1:<port>/<key>, a key of its own that goes when the process ends)
// and none of the credentials. The proxy adds them and holds every request to the gate's rules, however it was sent
// (the gated command, curl, a script): allow goes, deny is refused, and a call to confirm goes only once, after
// larkCheck let that very call through (the phone confirmed it, or "Always allow in this session" covers it). Printing the
// environment so yields an address that works on this machine only and skips nothing.
//
// In a health conversation (docs/assistant/health.md "Outbound") every write goes that way, whatever the rules say: the address of
// a process started in the health space is marked so when it is opened, and a write there goes only with the grant larkCheck
// gave it after the phone confirmed, as larkCheck itself holds it. Reads go as everywhere.
//
// The proxy also sees what the API answered. A write it forwarded that came back 2xx is told to the manager
// (proto.MethodLarkSent), which keeps it in the sent-as-user ledger with how the gate let it through (docs/extensions/connectors.md
// "Sent as the user", #5278): the gate decides before the command runs and cannot know whether it sent. What does not
// pass here is not in the ledger: lark-cli carries its own credentials, and a gate without Auth puts them in the
// command's environment.
//
// The report also carries the id the API's answer gave for the message the write made (LarkSent.MessageRef), so that a
// row can name it (docs/extensions/connectors.md "Sent as the user"). The proxy only watches the answer on its way to the
// command: it keeps a copy of its first gateReplyMax bytes and reads the id from the copy once the answer has been
// passed on. What the command gets is what the API sent, as it came and when it came.
