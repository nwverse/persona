// A collection round (InboxCollected) is written the same way (#91). It changes items in steps, and some steps let
// b.mu go before they change anything (a mail's text and a connector's settling are asked for meanwhile), so each
// step takes the round's write of an item before it changes the item (roundWrite, roundNew) and settles those
// writes before it lets b.mu go (settleRound). A write that still holds at a later step is taken up again, its
// snapshot staying what the row held before the round; an item something else moved in between gets a new write
// from there, the other move saving what the round had done before. Undoing is safe because the sources hand the
// same things in again: a connector's Collect answers from what it holds, a mail round reads each account's newest
