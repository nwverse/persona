// New items of a plugin's connector enter the inbox triaged (#1644): a collection keeps the items it starts aside
// (inboxBatch), and after the round the model is asked about a plugin connector's ones, in the background; only the
// ones that have a tier are listed and stored — the model's, or their fallback tier when the model can't sort them.
// One with no fallback is not written at all (no hidden rows): its connector answers Collect from its memory and
// the hub hands it back next round, so it comes in once the model works again. Meanwhile GET /api/v1/inbox says how
// many wait and why (triage). The hub's own sources (mail, its connectors, a built-in plugin's) go in at once, as they
// always did, and are triaged afterwards (triageInbox).

// Bounds of one admission: new items start within admitWindow, each gets admitTimeout; the ones not started by then
// wait for the next round (asked for right away when this one got anywhere). Variables for tests.
