// Hub transcription (#3862 phase 5, docs/assistant/meeting-minutes.md "Phase 5: hub transcription"): a meeting uploaded
// with transcription hub streams its audio to the hub (meeting_audio.go), which stores it (kb.AudioWriter) and hands
// it to a transcription contribution's live job (meeting_transcribe_job.go). Each recording being transcribed has a
// hubRun: it holds a sentence back while Persona speaks and then marks it Persona's echo or not by the echo rule
// (kb.EchoHeld, kb.EchoOf: kb/echo.go, against the speaking spans and the answers said in them), puts every sentence in
// the hub's transcript (hub_segments.json, kb.HubTranscriptPut; Persona's echo with its mark) and the meeting's own,
// while the role at their end is not off, in the live log (kb.LiveAppendHub), sending the phone its line frames.
// Persona's echo never reaches the live log, a line frame or the room. When the hub has no
// sentences the phone's text fills the live log (meeting_transcribe_fallback.go). After the meeting the final pass
// transcribes the stored audio again (meeting_transcribe_final.go). Nothing here logs what was said.
