// to (the hub leaves it out of devices.list and of the hello's machines). The hub says which are pending: its
// machine_trust table is the hub's, and it hands the list to the manager with the computers (devicewire.Config
// Pending, internal/devices PendingMachineIDs); this is that, read again every few seconds and whenever the hub's hello
// changes (a confirm changes its machines).
