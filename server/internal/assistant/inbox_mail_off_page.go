// A mail round reads each account's latest INBOX page (extmgr readMailAccount) and applyMail settles the threads on
// it. An open item whose mail is on no page any more (archived or deleted in the mail client, or pushed off by newer
// mail) would never be looked at again: neither read elsewhere nor past the window would file it, and the open side of
// the list would only grow (#5993). settleMailOffPage gives those items the same rules:
//
//   - past the window (its newest mail older than inboxWindow): as a mail past the window on the page;
//   - else the hub is asked once a round which of their mails are still in the mailbox, read or not
//     (inbox.mail_flags, at most assistantwire.InboxMailFlagsMost of them, the longest unasked first): an item whose
//     mail is all read or gone is read elsewhere; one with an unread mail still there stays as it is, and so does
//     every item when the hub can't say.
//
// Both end in mailReadElsewhere: an item that needs the user (Needs you, an FYI conclusion waiting for Got it) is only
// marked read, as on the page.

// mailOffPageAsk is one item's mail asked about: the item as it was when asked.
