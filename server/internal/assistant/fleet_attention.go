// Persona Link's "Needs you" summary (internal/link/attention.go, docs/operations/link.md "Needs you"): worked out in
// liveLoop from the Live Activity's inputs and handed to the devices, which send it to the computers' Persona Link
// when it changed. It reuses two rules the product has, and writes no third:
//
//   - What it lists and counts is the web app's "Needs you" badge (stateCounts().badge in web/src/lib/sessions.ts, the
//     count iOS shows) as it is: every agent whose row says "Needs you" but quiet tasks' agents and the assistant's
//     conversations, muted ones and ones waiting only on the assistant's decision included.
//   - Whether an item notifies (Notify) is the phone's push rule: once a card of the agent is the user's (pending.told:
//     tell rang it, when the phone is pushed; not while being recorded, nor while the assistant decides on it, nor a
//     card back from a reconnect or a restart that is not known to have rung), and never for a muted agent (mutedAs).
//     The web app's system notifications follow the same rule for agents with cards (lookingOnly, isMuted in
//     web/src/lib); for one in a terminal dialog before its card they ring at once, where the phone waits for the
//     screen card.
//
// spec/fixtures/attention holds the manager and the web app to both.
//
// The Live Activity counts otherwise (liveCounts: muted agents left out, questions being decided on counted) and does
// not change.

// linkTextMax and linkDetailMax are how long an item's title and place, and its detail, get in runes, the ellipsis
// that marks a cut included.
