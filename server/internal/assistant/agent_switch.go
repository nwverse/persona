// agent_switch (#5973): the assistant moves a running Claude Code agent to another launcher on its computer and goes on
// with it, in one step, when the user asks (the subscription's usage limit stopped it, say, and the user moved the
// main conversation to another provider already). It is the user's own switch from an Agent's chat (#5035,
// node/launcher_switch.go): the pick (session.modes with the launcher and from), then a message that carries it out
// (session.send with apply_switch). Where the user's message would go on the old launcher and leave the switch waiting
// (the agent busy, a draft or a dialog in the box), the assistant's is refused with nothing typed and the switch dropped
// (switch_now): it never types on the launcher the agent runs on, and never leaves a switch the user did not pick
// waiting for their next message. A pending usage-limit continuation of the agent is not sent afterwards: the agent's
// turn moved on, and workGuard drops a wake whose session did.

// agentSwitchWait is how long the tool waits for the node to carry the switch out: its checks before the quit take at
// most a minute and the rest at most five (node switchProbeWait, switchBudget), as the hub's switchSendWait.
const agentSwitchWait = 8 * time.Minute
