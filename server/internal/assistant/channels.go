// The channels (docs/extensions/channels.md): the ways of talking to Persona from a chat app — the Feishu bot (feishu*.go) and
// the bots plugins contribute (the channel extension point, channels_plugin.go). A message from a channel goes into the
// conversation the channel talks to, the turn is followed and its answer sent back the same way (channels_runs.go);
// what is asked in a conversation a channel drives goes there too. All of that is the assistant's. The hub keeps the
// transport — the open platform's long connection, pairing, the plugins' programs — hands the assistant what comes in
// (channels.receive, feishu.message, feishu.card_action) and posts what it is given (app.call feishu.*, channels.*).
// While the assistant is not connected the hub answers the owner's messages "the assistant can't be reached right now" itself.

// The channels' state: each plugin channel's settings and the conversations its messages went to lately (channels),
// the runs, the asks waiting in text and the messages taken (channels.state). The same keys the hub kept before; only
// the assistant reads and writes them now.
