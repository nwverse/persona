// The standing board (#6052, docs/extensions/bots.md "The waiting-for-you board"): with the bot's `board` switch on, /tasks keeps one card in the
// owner's chat that lists everything waiting for them, and edits that card in place instead of sending another. It is
// edited again, about boardSettle after a card opens or ends or a to-do enters or leaves "Please verify", and once
// when the assistant connects to the hub. Only a card that can no longer be edited (Feishu allows boardEditFor after
// it was sent) or was deleted is replaced by a new one, which is then the board. The message id and the time it was
// sent are in the chat's state (botState.Board). With the switch off /tasks sends its snapshot as it always did.
