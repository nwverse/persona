// A scheduled task's "Push when done" (#2396, docs/assistant/assistant.md "Push after running"): each run is a turn in a conversation, and the
// hub pushes every finished turn (hub/machine.go notifyFinished). Right for a morning briefing, wrong for a task that watches
// something ("push me when there is new mail"): every run pushed "task name · no new mail". A task's push is then
//
//   - pushEvery (""): every run's answer is pushed, as before;
//   - pushAsked: only what the run pushes itself (notify_user); a run with nothing new is not pushed at all.
//
// Such a task runs in its own conversation unless it goes on in one it came from (SessionID), and never in the main
// one (ownConversationIfQuiet). In its own conversation, that conversation's finished turns are not pushed when they
// end normally: the hub's finished push (quietTaskFinish in fleet_push.go, by the tasks of the last snapshot) and the
// channels' mirror (quietTaskTurn) leave them out. A turn the user starts in that conversation is not pushed either:
// the price of judging by the conversation, not by the turn — which, across queued messages, background turns and
// compactions, the node can not tell for sure (three rounds of review on #2396). In a conversation it came from (a
// leader's patrol, #3673), the run holds that conversation's pushes as a supervision message does (holdPushes) until
// the user or anything else speaks there: the conversation stays the user's. Errors, cut-offs and a stuck turn are
// told as ever, and so is what the run sends with notify_user.
