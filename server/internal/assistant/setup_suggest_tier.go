// A lower tier for the background supervisor, as one more line of the weekly block (#5805; section 9c of
// docs/design/proposals/main-chat-availability.md, docs/assistant/assistant.md "Recommended setup"). Unlike the other
// lines it is not a mechanism that is off: it says that the reviews the background supervisor made on the model its
// purpose (purposeSupervise) is bound to held, and that the provider it runs on has a tier below that one which is
// not its smallest. It is the block's in everything else: computed from the task_reviewed and todo_reopened rows of
// availability_supervision.go with no model call, named at most once in setupQuietFor, and never acted on (the
// binding is the owner's to change in Model Settings).
//
// Only down: nothing here suggests a stronger tier, whatever the numbers.
