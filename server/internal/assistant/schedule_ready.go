// A scheduled run waits for the main conversation to be ready (docs/assistant/onboarding.md 4.4 "Scheduled tasks"). A new hub has the
// weekday morning briefing on, and with no computer yet (or one asleep, Claude Code missing or signed out, a key that is wrong)
// every run failed and pushed "Scheduled task failed". Now a due run first looks at the readiness (no probe: nothing is spent,
// the node's two questions are cached): when what the run needs is not there, it is skipped and recorded as such,
// and nothing is pushed. The first run once it is ready again goes as usual, and the main conversation gets one line
// saying the tasks run again (a feed item of kind notice, written before that run is sent).
//
// Only what the run needs counts: a follow-up going into a conversation on another computer does not wait on the
// assistant's computer, and a task on a launcher of its own does not wait on the main conversation's Claude Code or
// model. "Run now" in the app is not held back: the user asked for it and sees what goes wrong. Nor is a one-off (a
// reminder, a follow-up the assistant set for itself): it is turned off once due, so a skip would lose it; it goes as
// before, and a failure is pushed and retried once.
//
// The wait is marked (and the notice written) only for a step the user has to set up or fix: a computer that is just
// asleep or offline skips the run too, but its waking is not news, and the notice would say something untrue.
