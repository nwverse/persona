// Replacing the main conversation (#4866, docs/assistant/assistant.md "New main chat"): the open tasks of the main
// conversation that was put away (POST /api/v1/assistant/main/new) or replaced in the settings go to the main one now.
// Their supervisor and their origin move together, as a closed leader's workers are rehomed (task_leader.go): every
// check that compares the supervisor with a conversation (agent_send's provenance, the done judge's, agent_supervise,
// task_review) then counts the new main conversation as the one that handed the task out, and the task's receipts,
// reviews and reports go to its feed instead of an archived one nobody opens. The ledger is kept as it is (criteria,
// reviews, round, parking, waits on the owner); a task waiting for review is signalled again to the new conversation,
// and the card of a task it now supervises is put there (the old conversation keeps its history). A task a leader supervises keeps its leader;
// closed tasks and the owner's own to-dos are not touched.

// handOverMainTasks moves the open tasks of conversation from, a main conversation that was replaced, to conversation
// to, the main one now; it answers how many moved. Nothing moves when from is a leader now (it supervises its tasks).
