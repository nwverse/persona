// All-day recording's watch → phone stream end to end (docs/assistant/day-recap.md「Watch to phone」), with only
// WatchConnectivity replaced by an in-memory link. The watch's real writer encodes synthetic speech and silence into AAC
// chunks in a temporary watch library; the pure planner (`RecordingDayOutbox`) decides what goes and which way, as
// `WatchDayTransfer` would; chunks travel in the real live envelope (`RecordingDayHeader.frame`) or as files with the
// header as metadata, events and acknowledgements as their JSON. The phone's real intake stores and acknowledges them in
// a temporary day store, which applies the control events; its transcription lane (an engine answering after a fixed
// delay) and its upload (to a hub keeping day recordings in memory) take the text the rest of the way.
//
// Deterministic: one wall clock, moved only by the test, drives every deadline (a reply timeout, a backoff), and the
// lanes run when the test says. The only real waits are the measured work; latency is read on the monotonic clock.
