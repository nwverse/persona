/// The list column of a split, driven from UIKit (#4206; iPad and the open iPhone Duo).
///
/// - **Gestures and the drag only.** Whether the column lies beside the page or over it is SwiftUI's, by the page's least
///   width (`SplitPageMin`), never set here: SwiftUI sets the split's behavior and the page's least width back on every
///   update, and a value set here and taken back each time laid the split out again and again until the scene ran out of
///   its 10 seconds (0x8BADF00D, #4206).
/// - **Slid by a finger, as Feishu's** (`drags`), from the window's leading edge while the column is away, from the line
///   beside it while it shows. Drawn from pictures of the screen (`Drag`), the top and side bars in them: as the finger
///   lands, the column's (the window's leading edge to the line) and the page's (the line to the trailing edge; the whole
///   window where the column lies over the page, which stays where it is), each stretched or squeezed between the line
///   and its edge as the line follows the finger, both blurred more as it goes. Let go, it settles out or away by how far
///   it went and how fast, the line springs there, and the pictures fade. A guide line in the theme color marks the line
///   while it moves (as Feishu's). The split itself changes at most once, under
///   the pictures: coming out, as the finger lands (the column's picture is then of the column as it is); going away, as
///   the finger lets go (where the column lies over the page, as it lands, for the page's picture without it). Nothing is
///   laid out while the finger moves, and the split's behavior is never set: laid over the page for an earlier drag, the
///   Agents tab's split (Separate sidebars) took its column away and the column slid on as an empty space.
/// - **Gestures.** A page that can go back keeps the edge for its own swipe back (`SwipeBack`): the column comes from its
///   button there. The line's grab area is a tap target wide and away from the rows, whose swipes (close, delete) stay
///   theirs; a drag starts only sideways. Regular width has no other sideways gesture (the shell's pager is the phone's).
