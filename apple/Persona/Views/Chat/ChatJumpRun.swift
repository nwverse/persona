/// (#5076)」). It stops a glide where it is, puts the list a

/// went there, and asking for it again changed nothing (docs/lessons/ios.md「Jump to Latest during a glide」); and its
/// animated scroll drew every text on screen again on every frame, which in a long Chinese answer was most of each
/// frame (docs/lessons/ios.md「Animated jumps redraw every text they pass」). A finger taking the list ends it where it is.
