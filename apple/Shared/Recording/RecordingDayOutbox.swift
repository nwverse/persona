/// How the watch's all-day recording reaches the phone (docs/assistant/day-recap.md「Chunks」,「Control events」and
/// 「Acknowledgements and retries」): which unacknowledged chunk or control event goes now, and which way. Pure and
/// `nonisolated`, so the rules are unit tested on the phone's test target while the watch's `WatchDayTransfer` only
/// carries them out over WatchConnectivity. Nothing here drops anything by age: only an acknowledgement takes a chunk
/// or an event out (the watch's age limit is `RecordingDayWatchLedger.ageOut`, which reports the loss).
///
/// The rules, in the order they apply:
/// - Suspending (the app is about to stop running: a pause, a stop, a halt, a background refresh): everything not
///   already with the system is queued with it now, chunks as files and events as user info, messages still awaiting
///   their reply included, since a message dies with the app and a queued transfer doesn't. The phone drops what it
///   already holds.
/// - Becoming reachable: outstanding files of chunks that fit a message are cancelled and the chunks go live, oldest
///   first; bigger ones (the minute-long chunks recorded out of reach) stay with the system.
/// - Reachable: events and every chunk that fits a message (an envelope under `maxMessageBytes`) go by message, oldest
///   first, at most `maxInFlightMessages` of each at once; a bigger chunk goes as a file. In Low Power Mode chunk
///   messages wait until the oldest of them ended `lowPowerHoldSeconds` ago, then all go together. A chunk whose
///   message failed and that is `liveDelaySeconds` behind goes as a file, its retry still awaiting a reply included:
///   the live path doesn't hold audio longer than that.
/// - Not reachable: chunks go as files as soon as they are finished (at most `maxOutstandingFiles` with the system at
///   once) and events as user info.
/// - Retries: a message without its acknowledgement after `ackTimeout`, or with an error, goes again after a backoff
///   (`backoffFirst` doubling to `backoffMax`). A queued transfer goes again only after the system reports it failed,
///   or when no acknowledgement came `fileAckTimeout` after it was delivered or was found gone from the system's
///   queue; at most one is with the system per chunk or event. A failed message's backoff doesn't hold back the
///   queued way: such a chunk may still go as a file at once. Becoming reachable retries at once.
