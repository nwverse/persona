/// reply jump. This reveals what has arrived at an even pace instead: a little slower than the stream's average so far
/// (`paceShare`, so the reveal is still going when the next burst comes), faster when more is waiting (characters
/// waiting drain at waiting / `maxLag` a second), and never slower than `minRate`. Replayed on recorded replies, it left
