// gone (a laptop waking up, a tab coming back after its socket went quiet), is lost without a word: the hub kept the
// agent Unread and the page showed it green again with the next list. A mark stays until a list from the hub shows it
// recorded (a later `seen_at`) or the agent moved on; until then the agent is shown seen and the mark goes again
// (over HTTP when the socket's is not taken in time, over the socket again after a reconnect).
//
// Only the hub's own times are compared with each other (its `seen_at`, the machine's `updated_at`): the page's clock
// only says when to try again and when to give up.
