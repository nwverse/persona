// (Plan mode included, which the chip's own menu leaves to the + panel) instead of sending the words, wherever the chip
// is shown (an Agent with modes while it runs, a Persona conversation). Picking a mode switches the running session as
// the chip does (POST …/modes): at once where the agent takes it while it runs; Full access for a terminal Claude Code
// started without a bypass flag restarts the session in it once its turn is over (node/mode_restart.go), which its row
// says before it is picked; a Persona conversation's Full access takes effect with its next message.
