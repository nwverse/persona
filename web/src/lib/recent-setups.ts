// New agent's recent setups (#2134): each setup that started an agent (computer, folder, launcher, model, permission mode,
// effort), newest first, so a tap fills the form with one of them again. The rules are the ones iOS, Mac and Android follow
// (spec/fixtures/recents/README.md, checked against recent_setups.json); the list stays in this browser, for this hub (the
// page is the hub's own, so its localStorage is too), and holds ids only, never a message.
