// Finished Markdown drawn once per content (#2465, docs/web/web.md "Markdown cache and on-demand highlighting"). The React
// tree that react-markdown's synchronous Markdown() makes of a block is kept, so a block drawn again from the same input
// skips the whole parse (micromark, mdast, hast, the rehype plugins, the JSX): a conversation opened again (ChatView
// remounts per conversation) or a reply that re-renders for another reason. The key is everything that tree is made
// from: the Markdown text, the remark plugin list (by identity), which rehype plugins run (KaTeX in or not, the
// path-link set) and the machine and directory the link components belong to; anything new a tree is made from must
// join the key, or a kept tree is drawn stale. A tree is plain data (elements and the hast nodes they carry), so one tree can be drawn
// in several places at once. Streaming and fading blocks are not kept: they change at every update.
