// Picking messages to forward at once (#3838; iOS PickRow / PickBar, and Inbox's Select, views/inbox/InboxList.tsx): a
// checkbox over each message with a Forward (PickRow, drawn by MessageActions in the row's first place) and the bar in the
// composer's place (PickBar): Cancel, how many are picked, and Forward N, off while none is; Escape cancels too, and
// Cancel leaves the chat as it was, the composer back with its draft. A pick past FORWARD_MOST is refused with a toast
// from the bar. A chunk that comes with Forward to: its Select messages… hands these to the chat (picking-parts.ts) as it
// starts picking, so nothing of it is on the first screen.
